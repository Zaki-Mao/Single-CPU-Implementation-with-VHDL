# Single-CPU-Implementation-with-VHDL

Final Project of *CO102 Computer Hardware Experiment* course, MUST. 

## Overview

The project of this experiment is to build a single-cycle processor (MinCPU) based on the theoretical knowledge we have learned in the Principles of Computer Composition course, including MIPS instructions and knowledge of the datapath, to complete a cpu in VHDL. In the cpu experiment, we are supposed to simulate the cpu in ISE Design Suite 14.7 software according to the theoretical explanation of the teacher. at the same time, we build and complete the final cpu from the 17 components in datapath in different categories to realize its functions.
